v 2.0.1

Type of application parameters property changed from string to dictionary (CpbpApplication.cs property)

v 2.0.x

Some features have been removed from the library to simplify the infrastructure. these features can be added manually later, according to the needs of the application.
Changes were also made in some parts of the library. I recommend that you do not upgrade your version without reviewing the changes.

CpbpProgram.cs, Cppb Application.cs and other objects many changes for simply using experiences.

1. CpbpProgram changes;

    - ProgramStart<> method is removed
    - SetArguments method is removed
    ...

2. CpbpApplication changes;

    - ExecutationOrder property removed (because for large applications it was difficult to manage this feature of Cpbp through a feature on CpbpApplication).
    - IsRequired property changed abstract to virtual (this property will be false by default, so it was changed to avoid creating code redundancy when not needed).
    - ApplicationParameter to ApplicationParameters (this change has been made to manage the situation that more than one parameter is required for a Cpbp application.)
    - LogBuilder property removed
    - IsThrowException property removed 
    - Exception property removed
    - IsRequired property removed
    ...

3. ICpbpApplicationHandler changes;

    - Project moved to home directory. Hence Cpbp.Dependency namespace was removed.
    - The parameter of the "Handle" method has been changed to string array.
    ...
